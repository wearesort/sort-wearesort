  Here's an introduction to my awesome blog post on awesomeness from awesome
  city!


  Look out, there's some tasty magic coming up in the body!

Here's some body text, because what is a head without a body in a world of awesomeness???

**Bolded text**

_Italicised text_

# Let's bang in an H1 whilst we're at it

Chuck a bit of paragraph text in down here right after the H1 for good measure

## Follow it up with a little H2

Then spice up the mix with another bit of paragraph text

{% include icon-header.html icon="tick-box custom" label="label here" %}

If we're feeling really saucy, let's add a bunch of:

* Unordered list items
* Because what is a pistol without a bullet
* ...point?

You might think I've gone mad in writing this article but let me give you three reasons why it's totally sane:

1. I can use an ordered list item
2. This is a good test of all the different WYSIWYG tools at my disposal
3. Just trust that I'm sane

Look, I can even add an image to the body:

![This image now has some alt text](https://res.cloudinary.com/wearesort/image/upload/v1546499318/branding/Sort-logo.png "This image now has a title")

That's like having a kick ass tattoo, right on the body!

All of this was done in a rich text editor, not needing to use markdown at all (though I can see that little toggle selector tempting me like a big red launch button).

Overall Martin, je suis impressed! Nice work mate.
