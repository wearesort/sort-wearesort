<h1>The Sort Code</h1>
<p>We are Sort. We're a bit different from your average digital company, but we think that's a good thing.</p>
<p>Together, our team have created a set of guiding principles for our business based on our wealth of experience and shared belief in doing what’s right for our clients, our industry, society, and ourselves.</p>
<p>These combine to form The Sort Code:</p>

<p>As a team, we are bound by and wholeheartedly believe in our principles that we’ve established together. However, we fully understand that as our world changes, so too will our principles. We therefore commit to staying agile as a business, which involves iterating The Sort Code as we progress.</p>
