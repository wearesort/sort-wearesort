Origins story
=============
Sort came about when a bunch of like-minded individuals from digital backgrounds, who'd previously crossed paths, were fed up with what they saw around them.

Having worked both client side - as product owners and project leads - and agency side - as consultants, designers, and developers - they'd collectively seen, time and time again, businesses and organisations attempting to solve perceived immediate problems instead of understanding the underlying issues and tackling them head-on.

Sort was founded on the notion that businesses have been paying people like us to design, build, and deliver solutions that they don't even need. Unfortunately, there are many consultancies and agencies who will simply build any solution you ask rather than working with your business to understand the root goals, needs and challenges that will result in delivering real, positive outcomes.

**Note:** Positive outcomes = achieving strategic goals, solving problems, or seizing opportunities.

Together, we founded Sort to make a difference and do whatâ€™s right for our clients, our industry, society, and ourselves.

We say no to doing what we're told, working in silos, unnecessary complexity, and band-aid solutions. It's unsustainable, costly, and we've seen it lead to failure both internally and through 3rd party agency relationships.

Instead, we say yes to challenging the status quo and focusing on delivering positive, measurable outcomes through open and collaborative long-term partnerships where we fully understand the world of our clients and their users. Altogether, this ultimately leads to greater ROI.

To start our journey, we took these shared beliefs and distilled them into a shared set of values, characteristics and principles, which now forms part of our company's DNA. We've called it [The Sort Code](/the-sort-code/).
