About us
========
We are Sort. We're a bit different from your run-of-the-mill digital company, but we think that's a good thing.

At a glance:
- Our team of 20 includes highly skilled consultants, UX/UI & service designers, and developers. [Meet our team](/team/).
- We primarily work remotely, spending time on-site with clients as needed. Many of our team members are based in London and around the M25 but we have colleagues in Southampton, Scotland, and Ireland.
- Collectively, we’ve got lots of experience in a wide variety of industries across private and public sectors.

Together, our team have created a set of guiding principles for our business based on our wealth of experience and shared belief in doing what’s right for our clients, our industry, society, and ourselves. These combine to form [The Sort Code](/sort-code/).
