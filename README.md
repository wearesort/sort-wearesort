#Getting started

##Jekyll
This site runs on Jekyll. To build and serve it locally, you need to have Jekyll installed. If you don't, see [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for instructions on how to install Jekyll. To start developing:
```
$ jekyll serve
```

##Sematic UI
This site's front-end is built with Semantic UI, which uses Gulp. If you don't already have it, [here](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/v3.9.1/docs/getting-started.md) are the instructions on how to install Gulp. When you have it running, build the front-end:
```
$ cd assets/semantic
$ gulp build
```
